          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12">Introduction</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            The City of Berkeley is home to over 120,000 residents 1 , including
            families and students, spread across 10.5 square miles 2 . With
            roughly 12,000 residents per square mile, Berkeley is among the most
            densely populated cities in California.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            In such environments, uneven transit access can create meaningful
            constraints on daily mobility particularly if areas with lower
            service availability coincide with households that are less likely
            to own a car. Understanding whether transit accessibility is
            distributed consistently across space and time is therefore
            important for evaluating how well the transit system aligns with
            underlying mobility needs.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            This raises an important question: within Berkeley, how does spatial
            transit accessibility—defined as coverage within a 6-minute (500 m)
            walk of an AC Transit stop—and temporal transit
            accessibility—defined as weekday scheduled bus arrivals per 1,000
            residents by time block—relate to 2020 vehicle ownership patterns
            across census tracts?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Data Description</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Population data is measured at the census block level, while vehicle
            ownership data is available at the census tract level. Spatial
            boundary files define the study area and support alignment across
            census geographies. Transit data include both bus stop locations and
            scheduled weekday service by stop, representing planned service
            availability.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Data Preperation</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Minor data cleaning was performed to ensure consistency across
            datasets. All spatial layers were projected to a common coordinate
            reference system and filtered to Berkeley census tracts. No
            imputation was required for missing census attributes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Methods</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            The analysis is restricted to the Berkeley land boundary to exclude
            non-residential areas without population, pedestrian networks, or
            bus stops. Census tracts, census blocks, and bus stops were filtered
            to this boundary.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Walking access is defined as a 6-minute (approximately 500 m)
            network-based walk from a bus stop. 3 Isochrones for each stop were
            generated using an OSMnx pedestrian network of Berkeley and unioned
            into a single polygon representing walkable access. Population
            coverage was measured at the census block level using area-weighted
            intersection with the walk access polygon. Walking access was
            visualized using an interactive map, where individual layers can be
            toggled on and off.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Transit access is defined as scheduled AC Transit bus arrivals.
            Hourly weekday schedules were obtained by querying the AC Transit
            API for all unique bus routes, then aggregated into time blocks and
            assigned to census tracts based on stop location. Bus arrivals were
            then normalized by the population covered within each tract. Transit
            access was visualized using a spatiotemporal choropleth map and box
            plots to summarize variation in transit accessibility across census
            tracts and time periods.

            Building on these visualizations, box plots were used to examine the
            distribution of transit accessibility across time blocks and to
            identify periods with greater variability for focused analysis.
            Census tracts were then classified based on whether their
            accessibility values fell in the bottom 25% (low-access) or top 25%
            (high-access) citywide within the selected time block. These groups
            were compared to assess differences of zero-vehicle households
            across levels of transit access as part of equity analysis.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Equity is defined as how evenly transit access is distributed across
            residents and evaluated by comparing zero-vehicle household shares
            between lower-access (bottom 25%) and higher-access (top 25%) census
            tracts within each time block.

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Results</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Approximately 115,890 residents (93.2%) of Berkeley’s population
            live within a 6-minute walk of at least one AC Transit bus stop,
            indicating near-universal spatial coverage. However, a small share
            of residents remains outside walkable transit catchments.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Citywide weekday scheduled arrivals per 1,000 residents vary
            substantially by time of day and peaking during the midday period,
            even when restricting the analysis to residents within walking
            distance of a bus stop.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Two census tracts corresponding to the Berkeley Marina and the UC
            Berkeley campus were excluded from choropleth visualizations due to
            very low residential populations that inflate per-capita values.
            These tracts are dominated by non-residential land uses and are not
            comparable to surrounding neighborhoods.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Although median bus arrivals are highest during midday, the
            interquartile range and whiskers are widest during this period,
            suggesting greater spatial unevenness despite higher overall service
            levels, motivating further analysis. Census tracts were classified
            based on whether their midday accessibility fell in the bottom 25%
            or top 75% percentiles. Comparisons of zero-vehicle household shares
            across these groups show similar medians and substantial overlap.
            After excluding a campus-adjacent outlier tract dominated by the
            student population, differences between groups are minimal.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Limitations</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Our analysis, while informative, contains limitations. For example,
            we measure scheduled transit accessibility rather than real-time
            reliability, delays, or service disruptions. Furthermore, walking
            access thresholds do not account for differences in mobility,
            pedestrian conditions, or terrain. Tracts that have very small
            residential populations relative to transit service levels inflated
            transit access values driven by small denominators. These tracts
            were excluded from some visualizations to avoid misleading
            comparisons. While the 2020 Census may reflect pandemic-related
            distortions, we used it to locate residential populations relative
            to infrastructure rather than to model travel behavior or transit
            demand. Overall, while there are factors that may obscure how
            transit accessibility is experienced in practice, the analysis
            provides a structured view of spatial and temporal transit
            accessibility.

        </div>
        <div class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Within Berkeley, where most residents live within walking distance
            of transit (93.2%), variation in scheduled bus service frequency
            does not show a strong relationship with vehicle ownership at the
            census tract level. This result does not imply that transit
            frequency has no effect on travel behavior, but rather that
            tract-level differences in frequency are not associated with
            differences in car ownership. From a policy perspective, this
            suggests that service frequency alone may be an incomplete indicator
            of transit equity, at least during the midday period when frequency
            and spatial variance was observed to be highest.
